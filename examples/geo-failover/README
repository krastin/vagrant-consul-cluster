Run setup_query.sh on a single server node in each DC, it will propagate to other server nodes within the DC.
Then run 'apt install -y nginx' on a bunch of nodes in each DC you want to include in the test.

check availability of services using the prepared query
$ dig web-app.query.consul @127.0.0.1 -p 8600

stop all web servers in one DC
$ sudo systemctl stop nginx

check the service again, it should point to the other DC
$ dig web-app.query.consul @127.0.0.1 -p 8600
